This is a React-based administrator dashboard application that provides various data visualization components and features for managing and monitoring different aspects of your business or organization. The app is built using [Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/), a popular React UI framework, and integrates several data visualization components, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, geographical charts, and more.

- **Calendar Integration**: Includes an interactive calendar where you can manage and track events. Users can add, edit, and delete events on the calendar.

- **Invoices Management**: Allows users to view and manage a list of invoices with detailed information such as name, phone number, email, cost, and date.

- **Geographical Data Visualization**: Displays geographical data on a chart to help analyze and understand traffic patterns based on geography.

- **FAQ Section**: Provides a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section to answer common queries and provide information to users.

- **Navigation**: Includes a sidebar for easy navigation to different sections of the application.
